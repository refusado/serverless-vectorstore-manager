  "description": "One of the best-selling games ever made, praised for its creativity, sandbox gameplay, and massive cultural impact.",
  "content": "Minecraft is a sandbox game where players explore a procedurally generated block-based world, allowing them to mine resources, craft tools, build structures, and survive against environmental threats like hostile mobs. The game features multiple modes including Survival, Creative, Adventure, and Hardcore, each offering a unique gameplay experience.\n\nThe game has no fixed objectives, instead encouraging players to set their own goals—whether building vast cities, exploring underground caverns, or defeating the Ender Dragon. Redstone circuits allow for complex engineering, from automated farms to working computers. Its visual simplicity belies deep systems for exploration, construction, and combat.\n\nMinecraft’s modding community, multiplayer servers, and educational editions have extended its influence far beyond gaming. It remains a staple across all age groups and platforms, with ongoing updates continually expanding its features and possibilities."
