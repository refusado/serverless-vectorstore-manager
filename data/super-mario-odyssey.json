  "description": "A 3D platformer that redefined the Mario formula with open-world exploration and inventive mechanics.",
  "content": "Super Mario Odyssey follows Mario as he travels across various kingdoms to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser, who plans to marry her in a grand, forced wedding. Mario teams up with Cappy, a sentient hat that allows him to possess enemies and objects by throwing it onto them — a core mechanic that transforms both puzzles and platforming.\n\nEach kingdom offers unique themes, characters, and challenges — from the urban sprawl of New Donk City to the food-themed Luncheon Kingdom. The game encourages exploration and experimentation, rewarding players with Power Moons for completing tasks, discovering secrets, or solving environmental puzzles.\n\nWith its vibrant art style, joyful soundtrack, and creative freedom, Super Mario Odyssey was widely acclaimed as one of the best 3D platformers ever made. It brought a fresh take to the long-running series while honoring its classic roots."
