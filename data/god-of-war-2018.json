  "description": "A soft reboot of the iconic action franchise, known for its emotional story, Norse mythology, and reimagined gameplay.",
  "content": "God of War (2018) follows Kratos, the former Greek god of war, now living in the realm of Norse mythology with his young son, Atreus. Following the death of Kratos’s wife, the two embark on a journey to fulfill her final wish: to scatter her ashes from the highest peak in the realms. Along the way, they confront gods, monsters, and internal struggles that challenge their bond as father and son.\n\nThe game departs from the series’ traditional hack-and-slash roots, adopting a more grounded, third-person perspective with a focus on cinematic storytelling and character development. Combat revolves around the Leviathan Axe, runes, and Atreus's bow, blending visceral action with strategy.\n\nIts exploration of grief, legacy, and parenthood set a new narrative benchmark for the franchise, while its stunning visuals and Norse setting helped redefine the series for a new generation of players."
