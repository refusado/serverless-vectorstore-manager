  "description": "An influential open-world adventure that redefined exploration and freedom in action-RPGs.",
  "content": "Breath of the Wild follows Link, a knight who awakens from a century-long slumber to a ruined Hyrule. Tasked with defeating Calamity Ganon and restoring peace, Link must uncover his forgotten past and reawaken the power of the Divine Beasts — four massive machines operated by fallen champions.\n\nSet in a vast and seamless world, the game encourages open-ended exploration and experimentation. Players can climb nearly any surface, cook food for buffs, and use physics-based mechanics to solve puzzles and traverse environments. Shrines scattered across the land serve as bite-sized challenges, while towns, NPCs, and environmental storytelling flesh out the lore.\n\nThe game received universal acclaim for its innovative design, art direction, and the sense of freedom it gives players. It played a major role in the Nintendo Switch’s early success and is considered one of the greatest games of all time."
